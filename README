MailFactory
======

mailfactory is tool for generating a mail object that you can use to test your apps email parsing behavior. 

install
=======
script/plugin install git://github.com/thinkbohemian/MailFactory.git


Example
=======

mail = mail_factory(:from_email => from_email , :to_email => to_email , :subject => subject, :body => body)

If you want to simulate receiving an email from "foobar@example.com", sent to "you@example.com" with a subject of "my cool subject" and a body of "this is only a test" you could create the object like this:

mail_factory(:from_email => "foobar@example.com" , :to_email => "you@example.com" , :subject => "my cool subject", :body => "this is only a test")

If you don't care about some fields, mail factory will auto generate them for you.

mail = mail_factory


TMail::Mail.parse(mail).to.to_s
=> "foo@example.com"

TMail::Mail.parse(mail).from.to_s
=> "example@example.com"

TMail::Mail.parse(mail).subject.to_s
=>"testing testing"

TMail::Mail.parse(mail).body.to_s
=>"This is a test body. Pretty generic really, should make it past most filters\n"
